<p> St. Xaviers is another of the nation’s, and the world’s, most excellent institutions of higher education, that maintains a speech and debate team that finished in the top ten in the nation in the past year. The campus regularly hosts tournaments on campus, giving the GPDT members exposure to other teams and events related to the club—a fabulous opportunity for networking. St. Xaviers is highly invested in enriching the experiences of their speech and debate students by providing as many resources and benefits as possible in their travel and competition, and team members are regularly recognized at National Debate Tournament championships as the best in that nation. </p>

<p> Whether in the workplace, a sports tournament or a music competition, finishing in second place could make you the real winner in the long run, a scientist has said. According to Chengwei Liu, associate professor of strategy and behavioural science at the Warwick Business School, those who win often do so because of a fluke and they actually have inferior skills. </p>
